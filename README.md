# Hypixel Skyblock Farming Scripts

## Description

This repo contains a few of my Hypixel skyblock farming scripts. They are not Java based, that may come in the future. For the time being they run off of accurately calculated time.

## Requirements

All required python libraries/packages are in the REQUIREMENTS.txt file. After pip installing all of these dependencies, the scripts should run fine.

## Usage

1. Run the app.py file in an IDE. A Custom TKInter GUI will pop up where you can fill in the information.
1. Script Specific Notes:
    - For Sugar Cane, you must face 0 degrees on the y-axis, and either -46.5 degrees, or 133.5 degrees on the x-axis. Using rancher boots, the speed should be set to 327.
    - For Nether Wart, you will face 0-1 degrees on the y-axis, and exactly 90 degrees on the x-axis. Using rancher boots, the speed should be set to 116.
    - For the Cactus, you will face 0 degrees on the y-axis, and exactly 90 degrees on the x-axis. Using rancher boots, the speed should be set to 200.
